This is my first attempt to write code in PHP.

This is a BMI Calculator.

To use it, enter your height in meters (i.e. 1.83 ) and your weight in kilograms (i.e. 81).

The answer is the so-called Body Mass Index, and has to do with the category in which you belong according to your weight and height combination.

The formula is: BMI= weight/(height)^2.
